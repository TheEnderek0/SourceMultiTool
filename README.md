### Warning! This tool is not directly supported on Linux, while maybe it will run on Linux-based systems, no support is guaranteed as of now!


## Instalation
Head over to the releases (on the right) and download the latest one. Unpack the .zip file, then open the folder. The program will be named "Source MultiTool.exe".

## Updating
This program does not support auto-updating, so in order to update you need to delete all of the files of the old version and replace them with new ones.
### NOTE: In order to save the configurations, leave the `settings.json` file. You can transfer it to the desktop, and then place it in the main program folder after update (Basically where you've found it before).
